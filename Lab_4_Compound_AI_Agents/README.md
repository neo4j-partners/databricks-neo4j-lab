# Lab 4 - Compound AI Agents for Aircraft Analytics

In this lab, you'll build a compound AI agent system using Databricks Agent Bricks that combines a **Genie space** (for sensor time-series analytics) with **Neo4j MCP** (for graph relationship queries). The Supervisor Agent routes each question to the right system and, for complex questions spanning both, queries each sequentially and synthesizes a combined answer.

> **Infrastructure:** This lab uses **shared** workshop resources — the Genie space queries shared Lakehouse tables in Unity Catalog, and the Neo4j MCP agent queries the **Reference Aura Instance** (the fully populated graph). You do not need data in your personal Aura instance for this lab.

## Overview of the Two Data Sources - Databricks Lakehouse and Neo4j Knowledge Graph

Aircraft intelligence requires both **time-series telemetry** and **rich relational data**, and each is best served by a purpose-built platform:

- **Databricks Genie with Lakehouse** excels at time-series sensor data — 345,600+ hourly readings stored in Delta Lake columnar format, optimized for aggregations, trend analysis, percentile calculations, and fleet-wide statistical comparisons over time. SQL is the natural language for these analytical workloads, and Genie translates natural language into SQL automatically.
- **Neo4j MCP Server with Knowledge Graph** excels at richly connected relational data — aircraft topology, component hierarchies, maintenance event chains, flight-to-airport routes, and delay root causes. These queries traverse multiple relationships (e.g., "Which components in the hydraulics system had maintenance events that caused flight delays?") and would require expensive multi-table JOINs in a relational database, but Neo4j handles them natively.

| System | Strength | Best For |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Databricks (Genie)** | SQL analytics, aggregations | Time-series queries, statistics |
| **Neo4j (MCP)** | Graph traversals, pattern matching | Relationships, topology |

The multi-agent approach lets users ask questions in natural language without knowing which system to query. The supervisor intelligently routes based on the question's intent.

## Data Model Overview

### Data Overlap

**Shared data** — Aircraft, Systems, and Sensors metadata exist in both the lakehouse tables and Neo4j nodes.

**Genie-exclusive** — `sensor_readings` (345,600+ rows). The high-volume time-series telemetry lives only in the lakehouse, where SQL excels at aggregations, trends, and statistical analysis.

**Neo4j-exclusive** — Components, MaintenanceEvents, Flights, Delays, Airports, and Removals, plus the relationships between all entities (`HAS_COMPONENT`, `HAS_EVENT`, `OPERATES_FLIGHT`, `HAS_DELAY`, `HAS_REMOVAL`, etc.). These relationship-rich structures are what make graph queries powerful for topology, maintenance history, and operational analysis.



## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:
- Completed **Lab 2** (Databricks ETL) — run **both** notebooks:
  - `01_aircraft_etl_to_neo4j.ipynb` (core: Aircraft, System, Component)
  - `02_load_neo4j_full.ipynb` (full dataset: adds Sensors, Flights, Airports, Delays, MaintenanceEvents, Removals — **required** for the Neo4j MCP agent in Part B)
- Sensor readings data loaded in your Databricks lakehouse (Unity Catalog)
- Running in a **Databricks workspace** with Agent Bricks access
- Neo4j MCP server connection configured in Unity Catalog

## Lab Overview

This lab is documentation-driven and focuses on **configuration over code**. You'll use the Databricks UI to create intelligent agents that automatically route questions to the right data source.

### Part A: Genie Space for Sensor Analytics (~30 min)

Create an AI/BI Genie space that enables natural language queries over sensor telemetry:
- Connect data sources: `sensor_readings`, `sensors`, `systems`, `aircraft`
- Add sample questions and domain-specific instructions (sensor types, normal ranges, fleet info)
- Test natural language to SQL queries for time-series aggregations and anomaly detection

### Part B: Supervisor Agent (~45 min)

Build a supervisor agent that coordinates two specialized sub-agents:
- Add the **Neo4j MCP subagent** for graph relationship queries (topology, maintenance, flights)
- Add the **Genie space subagent** for time-series sensor analytics (readings, trends, fleet comparisons)
- Configure routing rules so the Supervisor Agent directs questions to the right subagent
- Test single-agent routing and combined multi-agent queries
- Deploy as a serving endpoint for programmatic access

## Query Routing Strategy

The supervisor routes questions based on intent:

| Question Type | Route To | Example |
|---------------|----------|---------|
| Time-series aggregations | Genie | "What's the average EGT over the last 30 days?" |
| Statistical analysis | Genie | "Show sensors with readings above 95th percentile" |
| Trend analysis | Genie | "Compare fuel flow rates between 737 and A320" |
| Relationship traversals | Neo4j | "Which components are connected to Engine 1?" |
| Pattern matching | Neo4j | "Find all aircraft with maintenance delays" |
| Topology exploration | Neo4j | "Show the system hierarchy for N95040A" |
| Combined analytics | Both | "Find aircraft with high vibration AND recent maintenance events" |

## Sample Questions

### Genie Agent (Sensor Analytics)
- "What is the average EGT temperature for aircraft N95040A?"
- "Show daily vibration trends for Engine 1 over the last month"
- "Which sensors have readings above their 95th percentile?"
- "Compare fuel flow rates between Boeing and Airbus aircraft"
- "Find the maximum N1 speed recorded across the fleet"

### Neo4j Agent (Graph Relationships)
- "Which systems does aircraft AC1001 have?"
- "Show all maintenance events affecting Engine 1"
- "Find flights that were delayed due to maintenance"
- "What components are in the hydraulics system?"
- "Which aircraft have had critical maintenance events?"

### Multi-Agent (Combined Queries)
- "Find aircraft with high EGT readings and show their recent maintenance history"
- "Which engines have above-average vibration, and what components were recently serviced?"
- "Compare sensor trends for aircraft that had delays versus those that didn't"

## Getting Started

1. **Part A** (~30 min): Create and configure the Genie space for sensor analytics
2. **Part B** (~45 min): Build the Supervisor Agent with Neo4j integration

## Key Concepts

- **Genie Space**: AI/BI interface that converts natural language to SQL
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Standardized protocol for tool integration
- **Supervisor Agent**: Agent Bricks orchestration layer that routes questions to specialized subagents
- **Agent Bricks**: Databricks platform for building and deploying AI agents
- **Unity Catalog**: Governance layer for data and connections

## Performance Considerations

- **Genie**: Optimized for large-scale aggregations (345K+ readings)
- **Neo4j**: Optimized for relationship hops and pattern matching
- **Supervisor**: Adds minimal latency for routing decisions

## Next Steps

After completing the workshop, you can:
- Add more subagents (e.g., documentation search from Lab 3)
- Create custom tools for specific maintenance workflows
- Deploy the agent as a production service
- Integrate with external systems via additional MCP servers
